# Detecting COVID-19 in X-Rays images

We all know COVID created a global pandemic situation. Till now, there are 7,404,123 cases globally and 416,599 lives are gone. The fast and accurate detection of the COVID-19 infection is essential to identify, take better decisions, and ensure treatment for the patients which will help save their lives.
In this project, I have tried to develop a fast and efficient way to identify COVID-19 patients using Deep Learning algorithms.
I have developed a simple CNN model for COVID-19 detection. The detection model shows around 98.66% training accuracy and 96.66% validation accuracy.
This model is trained on X-Rays images, there are a total of 284 X-Rays images in which 224 images belonging to 2 classes in training set and 60 images for the validation set.

### Prerequisite
